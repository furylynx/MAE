Readme
==================

In this folder and its subfolders, the SWIG configuration files, the shell script for generation and the generated wrapper code can be found. 

Within mae/ all configuration files required to generate the bindings are present.

swig_java_wrapper.sh can be used to generate Java bindings for the mae library. Results will be written to the release folder. 
This folder contains the generated *.cxx C++ wrapper code as well as the Java files.

In order to not have to ship two libraries (libmae + libmaewrapped) it is recommended to include the generated C++ wrapper code (release/*.cxx) to 
the build of the libmae library. This makes it possible to use the native calls from Java on the libmae library.


Code generation
==================
Run ./swig_java_wrapper.sh in terminal to start the code generation.

Afterwards, compile libmae with the *.cxx file from the release/ folder.


Application
==================

Ship the .java files, as well as libmae.
To use the library from Java, at first the library must be loaded:
		System.loadLibrary("mae");

See: MAE/Samples/MAEJavaSample/ project to get an idea of how to use the native libmae from Java.
