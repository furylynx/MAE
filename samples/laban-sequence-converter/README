Readme
==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This is a tool to convert .laban files (XML-Labanotation) into bitmaps or scalable vector graphics.



Dependencies
==================
libmae
libmae_demo
Boost

When building, link against the following:

type:
cmake .
make
sudo make install
