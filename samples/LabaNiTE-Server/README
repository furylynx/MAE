Readme
==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a 
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications 
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This is the LabaNiTE-Server tool which provides network events on recognized sequences.


Dependencies
==================
MAE
MAE_DEMO
MAE_EVENTING
MAE_NITE
Boost.Filesystem

=> e.g. mae, mae_demo, mae_eventing, mae_nite, boost_filesystem, boost_system


Installation
==================

Compile LabaNiTE-Server from source:

When the tool is meant to be compiled, the headers for these libraries must be included. 
The tool must be built with a compiler supporting C++11 or greater (for some compilers 
this requires additional flags like GCCâ€™s -std=c++0x). When the indexer_fix.hpp files were 
removed from the libraries the include in the LabaNiTE-Server.cpp file must be removed as 
well.

An easy way to build the engine is to use the eclipse project and modify the paths for the
includes according to your system. Paths to the libraries might be required as well if they
are not present in the system PATH.


Documentation
==================

See code comments for documentation. This project has no doxygen comments since it has only
one main method.


Configuration
==================

In order to configure the tool, the config.ini file can be used. It must be placed in the folder
where the binary is executed. See the config.ini for more information.
