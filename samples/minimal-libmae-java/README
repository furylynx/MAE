Readme
==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This is a minimal example showing how to use the libmae library in a project.



Dependencies
==================
libmae

When building, link against the following:
mae



Installation
==================

Compile sample from source (using cmake):

type:
cmake .
make
sudo make install


Note:
To install the libmae JNI jar into the local maven repository (required to compile the sample) type (don't forget to adjust the version number, e.g. "0.10.0"):
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=libmae.jar -DgroupId=de.furylynx.mae -DartifactId=libmae -Dversion=$VERSION -Dpackaging=jar
