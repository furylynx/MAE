The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This is a tutorial showing how to handle listeners using MAE.
