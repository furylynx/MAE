==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a 
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications 
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This project is a demo of the usage of the Movement Analysis Engine in the context of Ambient
Intelligent Systems.
