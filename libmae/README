Readme
==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a 
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications 
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).


Dependencies
==================
xml2
xml++
opencv2

=> e.g. opencv_core, xml++-2.6, xml2, glibmm-2.4, gobject-2.0, sigc-2.0, glib-2.0


Installation
==================

Usage in another project:

In order to use the Movement Analysis Engine the library must be linked to the project
and the headers must be included. Additionally, the dependencies must be met.

___

Compile MAE from source:

When the engine is meant to be compiled, the headers for these libraries must be included. 
The engine must be built with a compiler supporting C++11 or greater (for some compilers 
this requires additional flags like GCC’s -std=c++0x). Besides, the flag for position 
independent code might be required (e.g. GCC’s -fPIC). The indexer fix.hpp files might 
produce errors and can be removed. They were introduced in order to fix indexer issues with 
the Eclipse CDT platform.

An easy way to build the engine is to use the eclipse project and modify the paths for the
includes according to your system. Paths to the libraries might be required as well if they
are not present in the system PATH.
