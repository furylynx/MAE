[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/furylynx/MAE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/furylynx/MAE)


The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).
