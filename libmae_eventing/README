Readme
==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This is the eventing part including client-server communication to provide network events.



Dependencies
==================
MAE
xml++
Boost (asio, system)

When building, link against the following:
mae, xml++-2.6, boost_system



Installation
==================

Usage in another project:

In order to use the Movement Analysis Engine the library must be linked to the project
and the headers must be included. Additionally, the dependencies must be met.

___

Compile MAE from source (using cmake):

type:
cmake .
make
sudo make install


Usage
==================

In order to use libmae_eventing in a project, the module can be included in a cmake project.  Please note that pkg-config files for boost might lack and you should generate them on your own. A generator for pkg-config files can be found here: https://github.com/nmante/pkg-config-generator. The pkg-config of libmae_eventing requires a pkg-config file for libboost-system, hence, a libboost-system.pc file should be present in the pk-config's path (typically /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/).
