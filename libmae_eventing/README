Readme
==================

The Movement Analysis Engine is able to analyze movements and provide events based on a 
described movements sequence (Labanotation). The engine can be used by other applications 
for further movement processing and filtering in ambient spaces (i.e., smart environments).

This is the eventing part including client-server communication to provide network events.



Dependencies
==================
MAE
Boost
 
When building, link against the following:
mae, boost_system



Installation
==================

Usage in another project:

In order to use the Movement Analysis Engine the library must be linked to the project
and the headers must be included. Additionally, the dependencies must be met.

___

Compile MAE from source (using autotools):

type:
./configure --prefix=/usr/lib/ --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
make
sudo make install

The boost libdir might differ in your system. Set the path to the path where boost is installed on your system. Besides, the install path can be changed too (--prefix=).

___

Compile MAE from source (eclipse project):

When the engine is meant to be compiled, the headers for these libraries must be included. 
The engine must be built with a compiler supporting C++11 or greater (for some compilers 
this requires additional flags like GCC’s -std=c++0x). Besides, the flag for position 
independent code might be required (e.g. GCC’s -fPIC). The indexer fix.hpp files might 
produce errors and can be removed. They were introduced in order to fix indexer issues with 
the Eclipse CDT platform.

An easy way to build the engine is to use the eclipse project and modify the paths for the
includes according to your system. Paths to the libraries might be required as well if they
are not present in the system PATH.
